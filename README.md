Breast cancer detection using machine learning

Motivation 9.56 Million People in the world die due to cancer. It is the second most deathly factor. Many people lose their dear ones due to it. So this is just a try to solve the problem of medical science using advanced computer science research techniques and algorithms.

Overview In this project, we have taken the best available dataset from different resources and tried to use different machine learning and deep learning techniques for the detection of cancer and optimizing the result achieved by machine learning models.

Dataset

1. The breast cancer dataset imported from scikit-learn which contains 569 samples including 30 real, positive features (including cancer mass attributes like mean radius, mean texture, mean perimeter, etcetera). Of the samples, 212 are labeled malignant and 357 are labeled benign.

2. The original dataset consisted of 162 whole mount slide images of Breast Cancer (BCa) specimens scanned at 40x. From that, 277,524 patches of size 50 x 50 were extracted (198,738 IDC negative and 78,786 IDC positive). Each patchâ€™s file name is of the format: uxXyYclassC.png( example 10253idx5x1351y1101class0.png) , Where u is the patient ID (10253idx5), X is the x-coordinate of where this patch was cropped from, Y is the y-coordinate of where this patch was cropped from, and C indicates the class where 0 is non-IDC and 1 is IDC.
